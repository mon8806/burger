# burger

## Project Overview

*  With node.js and all the npm's we created a database where the user can add a burger to be eaten or leave intact.

*  To run the app, the user will input node server.js which will make the server live.  Once the user goes to the localhost:8080 the page will load up. The user has a choice to add burger that will be devoured up or stay intact.  If the user wants to devour the burger, they will click the devour button and the burger will be more to the "Burgers devoured" side.
